# Text Address Maths
This Java 17 Swing GUI does addition on numbers embedded in text. 

Click the button to automatically exchange your clipboard and apply the offset in the top most edit box.

You can use the prefixes:
* `0x` or `0X` for hexidecimal.
* `0b` or `0B` for binary.
* `0d` or `0D` for decimal.

Currently, the default base is hexidecimal.

You can add a negative offset however the negative sign needs to go after the prefix if one was used. If the output base is hexadecimal or binary then the twos compliment value in its "in memory form" will be displayed.
